# Project Brief

**Project Name:** Flicket Agent Platform

**One-Liner:** A platform that handles all of Flickets AI Agents in one place.

**Problem Statement:** We need a single place to setup and establish AI Agents,
where they can share common logic, and common interfaces, but still execute and
run as independent Agents.

**Target Audience:** The Agents will be consumed by internal flicket satffg
(primarily via the Slack ai assistant integration) this agent will have multi
agent capabilities allowing it to call out to other agents as needed. Each
additioanl agent will be directly callable, and will be primarily for dedicated
tasks from within the flicket platform. The audiance for these will be event
promoters, or potetnial event atendees

**Core Features & Scope:** Multi agent orchestration - a single agent for
Flicket staff accessible via a conversation interface (the slack ai assistsatn
integration) and mulitple dedicated agents for specific uses cases, integrated
