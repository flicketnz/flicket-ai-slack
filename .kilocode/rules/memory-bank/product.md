## Problem

Flicket needs a unified platform to manage and orchestrate its various AI
agents. Currently, we don't have any agents, o anywhere to put them.

## Solution

The Flicket Agent Platform will provide a centralized system for setting up,
managing, and orchestrating AI agents. It will allow for the creation of
independent agents that can share common logic and interfaces, and a main agent
that can orchestrate calls to other agents as needed.

## Features

- **Multi-agent orchestration:** A central agent that can delegate tasks to
  other specialized agents.
- **Shared logic and interfaces:** A common framework for building agents to
  ensure consistency and code reuse.
- **Independent agent execution:** Each agent can run independently, allowing
  for dedicated tasks.
- **Slack Integration:** A primary interface for internal staff to interact with
  the agent platform via a Slack AI assistant.
- **Dedicated Agents:** Specialized agents for specific use cases within the
  Flicket platform, such as for event promoters or attendees.

## User Experience

- **Internal Staff:** Will interact with the agent platform through a
  conversational interface in Slack, allowing them to leverage the power of
  multiple AI agents through a single point of contact.
- **Event Promoters & Attendees:** Will interact with dedicated agents
  integrated into the Flicket platform, providing them with specialized
  AI-powered assistance for their specific needs.
